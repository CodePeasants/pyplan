# pyplan
Python framework for planning and managing human events. Good for events with any degree of complexity from
get-togethers to sports/game tournaments.

## Features
* Managing users and event members with status.
* Sending messages to members via any communication channel (email, text message, discord message, etc...).
* Supports nested events (e.g. a tournament could have child events for each match).
* Creating and managing potential schedules for events (members can vote on the times that work for them).
* Supports any kind of back-end for data persistence.
